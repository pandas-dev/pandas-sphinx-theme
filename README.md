# pandas-sphinx-theme

This repository contains the same structure as pandas for the documentation.
It can be used to perform tests for the documentation refactoring. The
refactoring is implemented as the `perform_refactoring.py` script, so it can
be reproduced in the pandas repository itself when it's complete.
